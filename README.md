# Translator

A simple web translator that works in your browser.

## What it does

- Translates text between 20+ languages
- Auto-detects language (works well with Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.)
- Real-time translation as you type
- Copy translated text to clipboard

npm install
npm run dev:full
```

This starts both the frontend (port 3000) and backend proxy (port 3001).
